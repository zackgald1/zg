# 👶 Early Life & Foundations

Before I became an engineering student, I was already learning how to build, lead, and adapt in the real world. Here's where that journey started:

---

## 🦅 Eagle Scout

I earned the rank of **Eagle Scout** after completing dozens of merit badges that gave me hands-on, real-world skills.  
My **Eagle Scout project** was building a bench for my local community — it was during this project that I realized I loved designing, building, and solving problems.

> That’s when I knew I wanted to become an engineer.

## 🏀 High School Basketball

I played basketball all four years of high school and was **team captain for two years**.  
In 2019, I received the **Student Athlete of Character Award**, which recognized leadership, perseverance, and teamwork.

Later, I became a **basketball coach**, helping younger players grow both on and off the court — a role that helped me develop communication, patience, and mentorship skills.
